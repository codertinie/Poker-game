## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Several music web applications already exist in the internet but lack freedom of speech. Most of the latter filter out negative comments which are often regarded as hate speech, leaving only the best comments. Many a time, this leads to misconception about a particular song. Music happens to be an art form that transcends language and misguided expectations will do more harm than good.
To solve this problem, we came up with a web application (LIMCE.FREEDOM), where honest reviews are needed, whether good or bad.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
LIMCE.FREEDOM app is made with love for music. Where words fail, music speaks. With limce.freedom, all opinions matter. 

Our applications allows users to: 
    • View the latest music albums available,
    • View and listen to songs in an album,
    • Leave a like on your favorite song,
    • Leave an honest review of a particular song.

## Technologies used
we combined the following technologies to come up with this great music application:
    • React for the frontend 
    • Raw css for styling the UI
    • Sinatra that uses Ruby to create an API for linking our Front-End React application with our Database
    • Postgress DB for storing our data
